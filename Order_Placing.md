To place an order, you need to choose the contract type you want to buy. After that, you need to choose the type of operation - buy or sell. Then you need to indicate the number of contracts you want to buy, specify the amount of leverage and press buy or sell button.

Your order will be placed in 6 seconds after pressing the button. This delay happens because a smart contract is being created specifically for your order.
After placing the order its status will be displayed in the field below.
