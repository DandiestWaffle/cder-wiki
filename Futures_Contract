## Futures Contract Overview

Futures is a derivative, or an agreement to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. On CDER.IO you can use non-deliverable futures, which means that the difference between the contracted asset price and the spot asset price will be calculated automatically at a time specified in the contract.
 
The underlying asset for our futures contracts is cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens.

Futures contracts do not require you to post full collateral as margin, because of this you can trade with leverage. The minimal collateral for a futures contract on our platform is 4% of its worth.
