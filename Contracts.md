On CDER.IO you can purchase contracts based on Ethereum. This is because we use ERC20 contracts for trading and all transactions are dispatched to the Ethereum blockchain. 

The price of each contract is $1. The platform checks your Ethereum balance as you place an order at the current rate. So, if 1ETH costs $800 at a given point in time, you can buy 800 contracts.

#### What is a contract?

CDER.IO contract is a derivative (futures, option or swap) with the terms set out in a smart contract. The contract itself is an ERC20 standard token. When you, as a maker, open an order for purchasing a contract, you transfer the trade data to a smart contract. The trade data depends on the contract type and the leverage used. Your order will be filled if a taker transfers this same trade data to your smart contract. Up to this point, you can always cancel your order and get your money back with no fees.
