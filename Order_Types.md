At the moment, you can place two types of orders on CDER.IO: limit and market

## Limit Order
Limit orders specify the price the trader is willing to buy or sell at. At the same time, limit orders are not executed immediately. They are filled only when a taker is ready to make a transaction at a specified price. A trader who places a limit order on the platform is considered a maker and pays no fees.

## Market Order
A trader who places a market order is considered a taker. This order is executed immediately. If the prices in the orderbook are more favourable than taker’s price, the difference will be refunded to the trader’s Margin Balance.
